Description: Export certificate data stored in your current directory's
             database.  By default, the certificate chain as well as the
             unencrypted private key will be exported to the current directory
             with the filename '<nickname>.(all|crt|chain|key).pem'.  If the
             private key is exported (via default or --key-only), then
             permissions will be umasked to a resulting 400 (owner read-only).

Example: export-cert --nickname test-server \
                     --filepath ./server.pem

Required arguments
  -n|--nickname    Identifies the certificate to be exported.

Optional arguments
  -c|--cert-only   A boolean flag indicating only the leaf certificate should
                   be exported.  File permissions will be left as-is.
  -a|--chain-only  A boolean flag indicating only the certificate chain should
                   be exported.  File permissions will be left as-is.
  -f|--filepath    The exported file.
  -k|--key-only    A boolean flag indicating only the private key should
                   be exported.  File permissions will be set to 400
                   (owner read-only)
  -r|--format      A string indicating the output of the format.  'pem' is the
                   default, with the only other option being 'p12'.  Also note
                   'p12' is mutually exclusive with any of the '*-only' flags
                   since p12 packages all the data.
  -h|--help        Print this
