Description: Create a certificate key pair that's stored in your current
             directory's database.

Example: create-cert --common-name test.localhost \
                     --nickname test-server \
                     --signed-by test-root

Required arguments
  -c|--common-name  For server certificates, this must be the domain name.
                    For client and root certificates, it just has to
                    be unique.
  -n|--nickname     An identifier used specifically within the nss database and
                    will be used in other commands to reference
                    this certificate.  Spaces should technically work, but don't
                    use them.
  -s|--signed-by    Must be either a nickname of a root certificate in the
                    current directory's database, or the string 'self'
                    indicating a self-signed root certificate.

Optional arguments
  -h|--help         Print this
